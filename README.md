# FPGA-SoC-Thermometer

FPGA-based thermometer built on Artix A7 FPGA and Microblaze MCU. Theromometer utilizes I2C to communicate with on-board thermometer to display room temperature on 7-segment
displays.

Push buttons on the FPGA can be used to determine whether the FPGA will display the temperature in Celcius or Fahrenheit.
